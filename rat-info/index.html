      Rat Information
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here are some basic necessities in setting up a home for your pet rats.
      Rats need food, water, treats, bedding, a cage and hideouts, chew toys, and comfort
      items like hammocks and blankets.

        <h3>Food and Treat</h3>

        <figcaption>
          Rats need food everyday, but can also hoard extra food to eat in the
          future. The best treats for rats are fresh human foods like spinach,
          apples, and noodles. They can also be fed store cough treats like
          yogurt bites.

        <h3>Water</h3>

        <img src="previousratimages/blue-rex-rat-baby.jpg" alt="Picture of Water">
        <figcaption>
          It is best to change their water every day. A glass water dispenser is
          best because it prevents the rats from chewing it, but plastic can
          work as well. My water bottle has cute little ducks so I can see the
          water level from a distance.

        <h3>Cage and Hideouts</h3>
        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/baby-pooch.jpg" alt="Picture of Hideout in Cage">
        <figcaption>
          Rats needs a lot of room to run and play. A cage with wire walls is ideal
          for good air circulation and so they can climb. Inside the cage, they
          should also have different places to hide and sleep. They need to feel
          secure and comfortable. I use tissue boxes and similar items.

        <h3>Chew Toys</h3>

        <img src="previousratimages/tilly-sleeping-on-kleenex-box.jpg" alt="Picture of Chew Toys">
        <figcaption>
          Rat's teeth grow their entire lives. It is important they have an
          abundance of things to chew on to help keep their teeth at a helathy
          length. Store bought item work such as wood ball chew toys but things
          like toilet paper rolls are also a good adition.

        <h3>Comfort Items</h3>

        <img src="previousratimages/marley-fidget-devlin.jpg" alt="Picture of Comfort Items">
        <figcaption>
          a hommock provides a nice alternate location for rats to rest. Fabric
          is the best material, but make sure you wash it. Putting pieces of
          cloth around the cage is a nice addition of bedding material for them.

        <h3>Bedding</h3>
        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/nugget-laying-down.jpg" alt="Picture of Bedding">
        <figcaption>
          There are paper-based and wood-based beddings. I prefer wood-based
          because it keeps any potentila odors to a minimum. However, wood
          beddings can irritate rat lungs if it's too fragrant of dusty. I
          prefer aspen as it has the lowest amount of dust and has no oder. Pine
          can also work, but stop use if rats sneeze too much.

        <figcaption>
          This is Audia, as a baby, hanging out with my brother's lizard.
          It's called a Uromastyx Lizard and they are primarily herbivorous.
          Not pictured is Audia's brother who, unfortunately, died as a baby
          when one of my brother’s snakes escaped it's cage.

        <figcaption>
          This is baby Oreo on the lizard's back, going for a little ride.
          Oreo was the first rat I ever adopted so I was nervous for this first
          rat-to-lizard introduction. But it went very well, and the lizard
          carried her around for quite some time.

        <img src="previousratimages/peaches.jpg" alt="Picture of Peaches">
        <figcaption>
          Female rats tend to be smaller than male rats, but Peaches was the
          most petite of all my rats. She never never liked being in her cage
          and would chew on everything until I took her out. At least her teeth
          stayed trimmed, they grow continuously throughout a rat’s life.

        <img src="previousratimages/insieme-jacob-and-aldabella.jpg" alt="Picture of the three
        blonde rats as babies">
        <figcaption>
          The three blonde rats, as babies, are drinking from a bowl of warm
          milk. Aldabella was technically my sisters’ rat, but these three rat
          siblings got to grow up together. Jacob was a very shy guy, Insieme
          was a very loving rat, and Aldabella was fed very well and loved to
          show off her big tummy.

        <img src="previousratimages/noodle-peaking-from-under-blanket.jpg" alt="Picture of
        Noodle">
        <figcaption>
          Me or my sister probably called Noodle out to come get a treat
          from us. Most of my rats were trained to know that when we made
          kissy noises, they should come to us.They were motivated by food to
          do this. Rats are very intelligent and can learn all kinds of tricks.

        <h3>Pookie</h3>
        <figure class="photo">
        <img src="previousratimages/pookie-under-blanket.jpg" alt="Picture of Pookie">
        <figcaption>
          Pookie was relaxing and poked her head out to say "hi" to the camera.
          My sister helped take care of Pookie and Noodle when I had to move
          closer to the city for school. They were extra spoiled because of this
          and both had wonderful lives.

      Thank you for checking out my webpage! I hope you enjoyed learning
      about something that you may have previously not known much about. Maybe
      for some people this was a bit of an eye opener that domesticated rats
      are a great option for a pet and the stigma behind rats is not
      necessarily true. I thoroughly loved all my rats and found great
      joy in giving them spoiled lives rather than being doomed to be snake
      food.
